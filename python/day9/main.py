# # # #Problme-1
# # # You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores.

# # # Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your program, you should have 
# # # a new dictionary called student_grades that should contain 
# # # student names for keys and their grades for values. The final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked.


# # #Solution


# # # student_scores ={
# # #     "Harry":81,
# # #     "Ron": 78,
# # #     "Hermione": 99,
# # #     "Draco": 74,
# # #     "Naville": 62,
# # # }

# # # student_grades = {}
# # # for student in student_scores:
# # #     score = student_scores[student]
# # #     if score > 90:
# # #         student_grades[student] = "Outstanding"
# # #     elif score > 80:
# # #         student_grades[student] = "Excellent"
# # #     elif score > 70:
# # #         student_grades[student] = "Acceptable"
# # #     else:
# # #         student_grades[student] = "Fail"
# # # print(student_grades)
